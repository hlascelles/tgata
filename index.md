## The lives and love of Francis Lascelles and Ann Catley

<h2 style="margin: 25px">by David Lascelles</h2>

The Lascelles became one of the wealthiest families in 18th century England through trading in sugar
and slavery in the West Indies.  They used their riches to scale the ranks of Georgian society, in
the Army and politics and ultimately into the peerage.   Today, Harewood House in Yorkshire stands
as a monument to their success.

The General and the Actress is a richly illustrated history of their rise, told through the
remarkable story of one of the Lascelles sons, Francis, an Army General who formed a lasting
relationship with Ann Catley, the top opera singer of the day.   Their liaison should have been
scandalous, except that the Georgians - behind all their manners and finery - loved celebrity
affairs.  Francis and Ann lived together for 20 years and had ten children.  Ann topped the bill
at Covent Garden and Drury Lane, Francis became a Groom of the King’s Bedchamber and looked after
George III during his madness.

The General and the Actress is set amid the turbulent events of Georgian times: Britain’s ruthless
pursuit of riches, its glittering society, its military triumphs and disasters - and the double
standards that allowed it to create an appearance of virtue and elegance while tolerating vice and
ugliness on a scale that takes our breath away today.
